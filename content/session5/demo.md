<h2>Speed Bumps</h2>
<p>A ‘speed bump’ is a mechanism for slowing down fast traders in order to give slower traders a fairer chance at the market. By implementing a timed delay (usually milliseconds) between the receipt of an order and the execution of its instructions, speed bumps are intended to mitigate the effects of asymmetric information by reducing the speed advantage of fast, sophisticated traders - such as predatory high-frequency traders (IIROC,  2018). However, critics of the mechanism (including many electronic trading firms) attest that speed bumps may make markets unnecessarily complex and unfairly favor certain market participants (Osipovich, 2019). Despite these concerns, nearly a dozen exchanges have proposed or implemented speed bumps. While the design of speed bumps differs across exchanges, all speed bumps in operation (except for IEX, which employs a “symmetrical” speed bump across all but pegged orders) are random and asymmetric, meaning that only liquidity-taking order types are delayed (Aoyagi, 2020).</p>

<h3>Speed Bumps: Mandatory Readings</h3>
<p>While some exchanges have readily adopted speed bumps and other speed-control measures, the question remains - are slower markets better? As you read through the following articles, consider whether you feel that exchanges should have a role in controlling the speed of their trading participants.</p>

<h3>Discussion Question</h3>
Do you think that speed bumps are an effective form of regulation? Why or why not? Consider whether or not you think that HFTs could bypass them.

<h2>Dark Markets</h2>
“Darkness” refers to a lack of pre-trade quote transparency - neither the buyer nor the seller posts a visible bid or ask (Hasbrouck, 2017). Dark pools are alternative trading systems in which dark trades of securities and other financial instruments take place; these marketplaces are frequently used by large block traders (such as exchanges and institutional investors) who wish to trade without revealing information pre-trade that may cause markets to move against them (Aguilar 2015). Dark markets function in contrast to ‘lit’ markets; in lit markets, pre-trade bid and ask quotes are publicly displayed. Examples of lit markets include national exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, and other traditional pools of liquidity.

<h3>Dark Markets: Mandatory Readings</h3>
<p>As you read through the articles below, think about the distinguishing features of dark pools and why they have been reported as a “haven for predatory high-frequency traders.”

<h3>Check for Understanding</h3>
Which three of the following six features/statements are associated with dark markets? Which three are associated with lit markets?

1. In this type of market, buyers and sellers post visible bids and asks.
1. Attracting sufficient liquidity has often been a problem in this type of market.
1. The New York Stock Exchange is an example of this type of market.
1. The prices established in this type of market are often relied upon by the other type.
1.  Participants in these markets often lack crucial information about how their trading systems function—and about the serious conflicts of interest they can harbor.
1. In this type of market, market impact is significantly reduced for large orders.


<h3>Discussion Question</h3>
You are participating in the market as an individual, slow investor (you are not supported by the sophisticated trading technology used by high-frequency trading firms). Would you prefer to participate in:

1. A dark market or a lit market? Why?
1. In a market with speed bumps or without speed bumps? Why?
