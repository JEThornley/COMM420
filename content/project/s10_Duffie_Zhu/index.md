title: Does a Central Clearing Counterparty Reduce Counterparty Risk?
author: Darrell Duffie & Haoxiang Zhu
summary: We show whether central clearing of a particular class of derivatives lowers counterparty risk. For plausible cases, adding a central clearing counterparty (CCP) for a class of derivatives such as credit default swaps reduces netting efficiency, leading to an increase in average exposure to counterparty default. </br><i>July 18, 2011, Darrell Duffie & Haoxiang Zhu </i>
